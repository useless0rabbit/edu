                    <h3>Our way of life</h3>
                    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the year 2084.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;When mankind ventured into space, we were curious to see if anything loomed behind those stars; unfortunately, we were right. The initial contacts were peaceful, but soon the people of Super Earth realized the potential danger of communicating with alien species, and before we knew it, they started our first intergalactic war.<br><br>              
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;For 40 years, the war has raged on, a conflict whereby three hostile alien species are hell-bent on a single goal: the total annihilation of the human species. Luckily, the fighting spirit of man has not decayed since the last great war on Earth. We are now stronger than ever; man, woman and child alike are encouraged to try their strengths in the ultimate test - to have the courage to defend Super Earth."<br><br> - Encyclopedia Description</i><br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Mankind has improved upon the old concept of Democracy. Utilizing computer aided voting software, citizens are asked to answer several questions, and the outcome of their vote is decided upon by the computer. This removes the uncertainty that existed in the old systems where voters didn't understand fully what they were voting for, giving us Managed Democracy.

                    <h3>Terminids</h3>
                    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ravenous Terminids are guided solely by an instinctive urge to reproduce, spread, and destroy any foreign life. They are a fast-evolving plague that threatens to demolish humanity on every single planet. As school children know, Terminids were allowed to live in specialized locations on human worlds known as "farms". Despite this generosity the Terminids showed their fascist nature by slaughtering the innocent civilians on the world. (Remember to report any disloyalty!)</i><br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Recent breakthroughs by Super Earth scientists have produced a chemical called "termicide" which is lethal to Terminids but harmless to all other life forms. Thanks to the bravery of engineers and Helldivers, the worlds in the Umlaut Sector were secured via the distribution of termicide and the culling of larger Terminid populations. Citizens are reminded that rumors of Terminids mutating from exposure to termicide are dissident rumors..<br><br>              
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Terminids are a species of extraterrestrial insectoids, sharing many similarities with arthropods native to Earth, such as multiple limbs, insect-like mandibles, and an exoskeleton. However, they appear to possess adaptions and traits more commonly associated with not only mammals and other vertebrates, such as an endoskeleton (internal skeleton) and respiratory system, but also fungi, such as reproducing via spores. This suggests that Terminids are actually two separate species, one animal and one fungal, working in a symbiotic relationship.

                    <h3>Automatons</h3>
                    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Automatons are mindless, bloodthirsty robots, coded for nothing but murder and violence. Their origins are a mystery, but their unthinking hatred of Freedom make them a threat to all citizens of Super Earth.</i><br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The Automatons are war robots that have similar ties with the previous cyborgs from the first galactic war. Currently one of two factions that are partaking in the ongoing war with Super Earth, they are known to spread havoc and destruction in their wake, purging freedom wherever they go. With their vanguard defeated, they make a return as the main fighting force for a counteroffensive.<br><br>              
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The Automatons are the next step in the evolution of the Cyborgs. As entirely mechanical beings, they no longer require traitors from Super Earth or corpses of fallen Helldivers to create new troops. Automaton all have similar characteristics like dark metallic bodies, digitigrade legs, skull-like heads, armor plates and a pair of red glowing eyes.<br><br>              
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Battling Automatons requires Helldivers to adapt a drastically different approach compared to battling the Terminids. Rather than relying on melee tactics like their bug-like counterparts, they are instead equipped with a vast array of projectile weaponry. Thus, Helldivers need to find a good balance between offense and defense, seeking cover whenever possible and focus on scrapping the Automaton's heavy hitters before they can unleash their devastating attacks.<br><br>
